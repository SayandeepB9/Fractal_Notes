### ORCA MATH
- Slm teacher student model
- improving the reasoning capabilities of SLMs is using frontier language models, such as GPT-4,
- ensembling
- larger amounts of data (e.g. 12M for Phi-GSM) or use tools or code to avoid calculation
errors.
-  Orca-Math-dataset, a synthetic dataset of 200K math problems, paired with GPT-4-Turbo solutions
- iterative learning procedure
- seed set
- Agent - Ask Me Anything
- Agent - Suggester & Editor
- Supervised fine tuning experiment
- Data construction q+ q- from q and preference dataset
- KTO Algo to train model3
- Use model3 to generate answers which are evaluated by gpt4


Dataset->add by numbers->add complexity->model1 mistral fine tuning
->4 answers->model2 kto dpo->answers by model2 evaluated by gpt4

### Chain of Verification

![alt text](image-3.png)
1. Generate Baseline Response: Given a query, generate the response using the LLM.
2. Plan Verifications: Given both query and baseline response, generate a list of verification
questions that could help to self-analyze if there are any mistakes in the original response.
3. Execute Verifications: Answer each verification question in turn, and hence check the answer
against the original response to check for inconsistencies or mistakes.(joint, 2-step, factored)
4. Generate Final Verified Response: Given the discovered inconsistencies (if any), generate a
revised response incorporating the verification results
Verification Questions:- Generated by the llm outperform heuristics. Yes/No questions should
be avoided.

### Self-Discover

Discovers the exact thought process required for solving the problem. The model then elaborates
on the thought process and provides a detailed explanation of the solution in a json format.
This is finally used to generate the final response.
Problems with SLMs:- wont understand the difference between the various thought processes

### Deductive verification of cot reasoning
![alt text](image-1.png)
Break down the question into parts and generate a well reasoned solution for each part by taking into account the given information and the previous responses.
Then we have the verifier module which checks whether the values are grounded and then it checks whether a given step can be derived from the previous steps and the given context.
Three kinds of check occur:- groundedness, calculation, reasoning

### Step-Back Prompting

First we ask the llm to give the concepts behind the concepts and principles behind the question.
Then the llm uses this context to finally generate the response.
