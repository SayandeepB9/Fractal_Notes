Errors:-
1. Most often the errors are conceptual like it could not understand catalna number,etc.
2. Faced problems in ones dealing with specific physical structures
3. Often to solve the problem is assumes things which are incorrect
4. Sometimes gets the question wrong
5. If it gets wrong solution the new tries are too similar to the old ones to have any impact
6. Code is incorrect and sometimes even the code outputs are incorrect like in B10
7. Only very simple questions or the queations which can be directly interpreted
as equations are correct
8. Correct code incorrect output. May be due to errors in handling very large number like in 20
9. ### In many cases a brute force approach can be undertaken since the limits are small
This can be helpful in increasing accuracy
10. Often arrives at a correct solution not in option like in B33. We can prompt to provide an
exhaustive list of answers and then match the thing
